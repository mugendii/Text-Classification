# Text-Classification
Using the provided dataset attached , develop a machine learning algorithm of your choice for text classification. You can use any combination of text representation and machine learning approaches. Specifically:
1. Choose and implement a text representation technique (such as bag of words, word embeddings etc.). Justify your choice.
2. Using the text representation from (1), build a machine learning model for text classification
(e.g. decision tree, neural network etc.). Justify your choice.
3. Evaluate your model using appropriate metrics of your choice.
4. Write a report outlining your solution, including a description of the machine learning setup (including a description and motivation of the text representation technique, an appropriate graphical representation if relevant), evidence of parameters tuning (if relevant), as well as the evaluation results (including relevant tables and graphs) and critical evaluation/reflection
